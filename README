-= Building CryptoNote =-

On *nix:

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.53 or later (except 1.54, more details here: http://goo.gl/RrCFmA).
You may download them from:
http://gcc.gnu.org/
http://www.cmake.org/
http://www.boost.org/
Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager.

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run `make'. The resulting executables can be found in build/release/src.

Advanced options:
Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>' instead of `make'.
Debug build: run `make build-debug'.
Test suite: run `make test-release' to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug' will do the same to the debug version.
Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++' before running `make'.

On Windows:
Dependencies: MSVC 2012 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.53 or later. You may download them from:
http://www.microsoft.com/
http://www.cmake.org/
http://www.boost.org/

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run this commands: 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" ..

And then do Build.
Good luck!
